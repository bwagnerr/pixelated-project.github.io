# Pixelated Project

Pixelated is an Open Source secure email soulution. There are a few things you can do with Pixelated:

- Setup your own secure mail provider using the [Pixelated Platform](http://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-platform)
- Connect to a secure mail provider through a self-hosted web client - the [Pixelated User Agent](http://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-user-agent)
- Setup an enterprise secure mail solution by combining the Pixelated Plataform and User Agent with the [Pixelated Dispatcher](http://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-dispatcher)
